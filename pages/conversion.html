					Saint Augustine’s well-known conversion to Christianity signified his realization
					of the grave weight of sins.
				</li>
				<li style="--order: 2">
					Years after the end of his adolescence, his conversion was initiated when he heard
					the voice of a child whisper to him the words <b><em>“Tolle, lege”</em></b>, which
					means <b>“take up and read”</b> in Latin.
				</li>
				<li style="--order: 3">
					It is implied that the literature he would involve himself in after this event were
					significant Christian teachings and stories from influential theologians prior to
					his time.

				<li style="--order: 4">
					Ultimately, it was Bishop Ambrose and his teachings that led
					Augustine to delve deeper into God and the Christian faith.
				</li>
				<li style="--order: 5">
					Saint Ambrose, the Bishop of Milan at the time of Augustine, was especially notable
					for passionately promoting Christianity against non-monotheistic beliefs such as paganism.
				</li>
				<li style="--order: 6">
					This impactful conversion that would shape the later years of Augustine’s life brought him
					to a path of devotion to Christianity and God, resulting in his ordination as a priest and
					eventually his consecration as the Bishop of Hippo.
