				He was <b>ordained as a priest</b> by bishop Valerius of Hippo in 391 AD.
				By 395 AD, he was given the position of <b>Bishop of Hippo</b> until his
				death in 430 AD. He was the Bishop of Hippo for <b>35 years.</b> During
				these years, he held the role of <b>representing Christ and His church,
				messenger of the Word of God,</b> and to <b>maintain faith and unity</b> of
				the whole church. His priority was the <b>pastoral care</b> of the people
				of his church as well as <b>spiritual growth.</b> St. Augustine was also
				one of the <b>Latin Fathers of the Church</b>, which are a group of known
				<b>Christian philosophers and theologian</b> who adapted classical thought
				into Christian teachers and created a <b>theological system</b> of power and
				influence on Christianity. St. Augustine wrote 100+
				works including the infamous <b>“Confessions” and “City of God”.</b>
			</p>

			<p style="--order: 2;"> 
				After living 75 years, St. Augustine was recognized as a <b>Doctor of the
				Church by Pope Boniface VIII</b> in 1298. He is the <b>patron
				of the Augustinians</b> and his feast day is celebrated on <b>August 28.</b>

			<h3 style="--order: 3;">Literary Works</h3>
			<ul>
				<li style="--order: 4;">The Confessions</li>
				<ul>
					<li style="--order: 5;">
						This particular work of St. Augustine is one of his most well-known
						and influential, for it delves deep into his own life, from his sinful
						adolescence to his God-fearing adulthood. His autobiography can be found
						from <b>Books 1-9</b>.
					</li>
					<li style="--order: 6;">
						Furthermore, there are many philosophical teachings and sayings included
						in The Confessions, reflecting Augustine's devotion to his religion and
						his fervent search for meaning. <b>Books 10-13</b> focus on these.
					</li>
					<li style="--order: 7;">
						Throughout the whole of The Confessions, it can be seen in its framework,
						the life of St. Augustine, that a person's life can be changed if they
						grasp the true meaning of their purpose. For him, it was his lifelong
						commitment to Christianity.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<li style="--order: 8;">The City of God</li>
				<ul>
					<li style="--order: 9;">
						Another one of St. Augustine's most important works, The City of God
						focuses on the ideology of being devoted to God and God only through
						the examination of human nature and their complex thought process,
						especially on the question of religion.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<li style="--order: 10;">Soliloquies</li>
				<ul>
					<li style="--order: 11;">
						The Soliloquies was one of St. Augustine's earliest works as a Christian
						for he wrote this just after his conversion into the religion. Here, he
						experienced many questions about life's meaning as he was now enlightened
						with God's teachings and the Scripture. There is a kind of anguish to the
						way he processed this newfound belief, and it is all reflected in this
						literary work.
