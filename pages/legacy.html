					St. Augustine desired for a life of devotion from God and separation
					from worldly and material aspects. He spent his days as the bishop of Hippo,
					focusing on his many obligations, traveling to church councils to teach,
					defend the Catholic Faith, and to find inspiration in his pursuit of philosophical
					writings, establishing a community for clerics in his church.
				</li>
				<li style="--order: 2;">
					Truly, Saint Augustine played a significant part in shaping the foundation of modern
					Christian writings employing his <b>theological style and philosophical influence</b>
					which continues to be relevant up till today. Specifically, Augustine contributed to
					the theory of knowledge and language to the <b>conception of good and evil.</b> He also
					elaborated on the <b>difficult questions concerning divine grace and the Trinity</b>,
					explaining that it takes faith to believe in it.
				</li>
				<li style="--order: 3;">
					The significant impact of the writings and Rule of Saint Augustine led to the Catholic
					religious order named Order of Saint Augustine (OSA) which was founded in 1244 in Italy.
					They held the purpose based on the Rule of Saint Augustine through helping people find
					happiness through prayer, serving the Lord’s people, and spreading the teachings of Jesus Christ.
				</li>
				<li style="--order: 4;">
					Moreover, the OSA were the <b>first missionaries to evangelize the Philippines.</b>
					It is without a doubt that the Legacy of Saint Augustine has greatly influenced
					Christianity in the country. Through the Augustinians, many schools, churches,
					parish houses, and even municipal buildings are named after St. Augustine of Hippo.
